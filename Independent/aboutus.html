            <h1> What is the Arts and Crafts Movement?</h1>
            <p>The Arts and Crafts Movement was a 19th century artistic movement in Britain. 
                It was lead by artists like William Morris who were unhappy with the Industrial Revolution. 
                These artists wanted to go back to a time when workers interacted with the products they created and weren't bound to factories. 
                To learn more about their ideas, check out the interactive artwork and see what you find!
